- **Cognitive Task Paradigms**: Fixation, memory (DMTS), visual/auditory discrimination, motor control tasks
- **Browser-Based Task Execution**: Playwright automation on Raspberry Pi edge devices for no-code task deployment
- **Welfare Monitoring**: IACUC compliance with session limits, environmental logging, health tracking
- **Multi-Lab Collaboration**: Organization-based isolation with template sharing capabilities

- **Server State**: React Query for API data with caching
- **Real-time State**: WebSocket events update Zustand stores

**Data Flow:**
1. Components use React Query hooks to fetch data
2. Data cached in React Query with automatic refetching
3. Mutations update cache optimistically and invalidate queries
4. WebSocket events update Zustand stores for real-time UI
5. Custom hooks abstract common patterns

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Query result caching with configurable stale times
- Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
- Automatic refetching (window focus, reconnect, intervals)
- Debounced inputs to reduce API calls
- Efficient Map-based status tracking

**Type Safety:**
- Full TypeScript coverage across API, stores, and hooks
- Discriminated unions for WebSocket events
- Type-safe query keys factory
- Strongly typed permission system
