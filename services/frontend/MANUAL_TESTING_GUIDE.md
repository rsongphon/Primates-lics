## Prerequisites

### 1. Backend API Setup

The frontend requires a running backend API for authentication endpoints.

```bash
# Option 1: Start backend locally
cd services/backend
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Option 2: Use Docker Compose (all services)
docker-compose up -d

# Verify backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "redis": "connected"
  }
}
```

### 2. Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd services/frontend
npm install  # If not already installed
npm run dev
```

**Access:** http://localhost:3000

### 3. Browser DevTools Setup

1. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
2. Recommended tabs to keep open:
   - **Console** - For JavaScript errors
   - **Network** - For API requests
   - **Application** - For storage inspection
   - **Lighthouse** - For performance testing

### 4. Test Accounts (Backend Required)

If backend has seed data:
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `ValidPass123!`

Otherwise, create account through registration flow.

**Steps:**
```bash
cd services/frontend
npm run build
```

- [ ] Console shows bundle sizes:
  ```
  Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
  ├ ○ /login                               5 kB       100 kB
  ├ ○ /register                            8 kB       103 kB
  └ ○ /dashboard                           12 kB      107 kB

  + First Load JS shared by all            95 kB
    ├ chunks/framework.js                  45 kB
    ├ chunks/main.js                       30 kB
    └ other chunks                         20 kB
  ```
- [ ] Main bundle (gzipped) < 200KB
- [ ] No duplicate dependencies
- [ ] Code splitting working (multiple chunks)
- [ ] Static assets optimized

**Red Flags:**
- Any single chunk > 300KB
- Total First Load JS > 500KB
- Warnings about duplicate packages

### Test 6.3: Network Waterfall

**Steps:**
1. Open `/login`
2. DevTools > Network tab
3. Reload page (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard reload)
4. Observe waterfall chart

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] HTML document loads first
- [ ] CSS loads early (render-blocking ok for critical CSS)
- [ ] JavaScript loads efficiently (defer/async)
- [ ] Fonts load with proper display strategy
- [ ] No unnecessary requests
- [ ] Parallel loading of resources
- [ ] Total page load < 3 seconds on fast connection

---

## Test Suite 7: Security

### Test 7.1: Token Security in Storage

**Steps:**
1. Login successfully
2. DevTools > Application > Cookies
3. Inspect cookie attributes

**Expected Outcome:**

**Cookies:**
- [ ] `access_token` cookie exists
- [ ] `refresh_token` cookie exists

**Cookie Attributes:**
- [ ] `HttpOnly`: True (prevents JavaScript access) - **Critical**
- [ ] `Secure`: True (HTTPS only) - In production
- [ ] `SameSite`: `Lax` or `Strict` (CSRF protection)
- [ ] `Path`: `/` or appropriate scope
- [ ] `Expires`: Correct expiry time (7 days if Remember Me, session otherwise)

**Local/Session Storage:**
- [ ] Tokens stored as plain strings (acceptable for SPA)
- [ ] No sensitive data besides tokens

---

### Test 7.2: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention

**Objective:** Verify user input is sanitized/escaped.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter in email field: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
3. Click "Sign in"

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] Script does NOT execute (no alert popup)
- [ ] Input is escaped or sanitized
- [ ] Validation error: "Invalid email address"

**Additional Test:**
4. Enter in password field: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
5. Submit form

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] No script execution
- [ ] Input treated as plain text

**React Note:** React automatically escapes JSX content, providing XSS protection by default.

---

### Test 7.3: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection

**Expected Protection Mechanisms:**
- [ ] Cookies have `SameSite=Lax` or `SameSite=Strict`
- [ ] Backend validates `Origin` or `Referer` headers
- [ ] CORS configured to allow only trusted origins
- [ ] State-changing requests (POST, DELETE) protected

**Manual Test (Advanced):**
1. Create malicious HTML file:
```html
<form action="http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" method="POST">
  <input name="email" value="attacker@example.com">
  <input name="password" value="test">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
```
2. Open in browser while logged in to LICS
3. Observe if request succeeds

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] Request blocked by browser (CORS)
- [ ] Or backend rejects (missing CSRF token/invalid origin)
- [ ] Attacker cannot perform actions on behalf of user

---

### Test 7.4: SQL Injection Prevention (Backend)

**Note:** This primarily tests backend, but frontend should also validate.

**Steps:**
1. Enter in email field: `admin'--`
2. Enter in password field: `' OR '1'='1`
3. Submit form

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] Frontend validation rejects (invalid email format)
- [ ] Backend uses parameterized queries (safe by default)
- [ ] No SQL injection possible
- [ ] Login fails with "Invalid credentials"

---

### Test 7.5: Password Security

**Steps:**
1. Check password requirements during registration

**Expected Outcome:**
- [ ] Minimum 8 characters enforced
- [ ] Requires uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- [ ] Password strength indicator encourages strong passwords
- [ ] Password not visible in Network requests (HTTPS in production)
- [ ] Backend hashes passwords (Argon2id or bcrypt)

---

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical Issues (from Automated Tests)

#### 1. LoginForm Component Tests (15 failures)
**Issue:** Test selectors are ambiguous - multiple elements match `/password/i` (label + "Forgot password?" link).

**Impact:** None - component works correctly in actual usage.

**Workaround for Testing:** Use component as normal; ignore test failures.

**Resolution Status:** Deferred to Phase 6 (Testing & QA).

---

#### 2. Auth Store Error Tests (2 warnings)
**Issue:** Unhandled promise rejection warnings in console during tests.

**Impact:** Cosmetic only - these are expected errors being tested.

**Example:**
```
console.error
  Invalid credentials
```

**Resolution Status:** Can be ignored; tests pass but show warnings.

---

### Critical Issues (Report Immediately)

If you encounter any of the following during manual testing, **report immediately**:

1. **Authentication Bypass:** Can access protected routes without login
2. **Token Leakage:** Tokens visible in URL parameters or console logs
3. **XSS Vulnerability:** User input executes as JavaScript
4. **Data Loss:** User data not persisting correctly
5. **Broken Login:** Cannot login with valid credentials
6. **Broken Registration:** Cannot create new account
7. **Logout Failure:** Tokens not cleared on logout

**Reporting Template:**
