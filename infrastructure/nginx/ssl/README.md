# LICS SSL Certificates

This directory contains SSL certificates generated by mkcert for local development.

## Files

- `localhost.pem` - Main certificate for localhost and local domains
- `localhost-key.pem` - Private key for the main certificate
- `server.crt` - Copy of main certificate (nginx compatible name)
- `server.key` - Copy of private key (nginx compatible name)
- `lics-dev.crt` - Development certificate copy
- `lics-dev.key` - Development private key copy

## Domains Covered

The certificates are valid for the following domains:

- localhost
- 127.0.0.1
- ::1 (IPv6 localhost)
- *.localhost
- lics.local
- *.lics.local
- dev.lics.local
- api.lics.local
- admin.lics.local
- grafana.lics.local
- docs.lics.local

## Usage

### Nginx Configuration

```nginx
ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;
```

### Docker Compose Volume Mount

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./infrastructure/nginx/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl:ro
```

### Local Development URLs

- Frontend: https://localhost:3000
- Backend API: https://localhost:8000
- WebSocket: wss://localhost:8001
- Grafana: https://localhost:3001
- Documentation: https://localhost:8080

## Regenerating Certificates

To regenerate certificates, run:

```bash
./tools/scripts/setup-ssl.sh
```

Or use the Makefile:

```bash
make setup-ssl
```

## Trust Issues

If browsers show certificate warnings:

1. Ensure mkcert CA is installed: `mkcert -install`
2. Restart your browser
3. Check that the certificate is properly mounted in Docker containers

## Security Notes

- These certificates are for development only
- Do not use in production
- Private keys are included in the repository for development convenience
- The mkcert CA is only trusted on the local machine where it was installed
